									<h1>My Story</h1>
                                    <p>
                                        I've always been fascinated by complex creative mediums. I had convinced myself that I'd be an engineer from a very young age. The intricate workings of machines, the beauty of structures, and the endless possibilities they offered captivated my imagination. I would spend hours tinkering with toys, dismantling and reassembling them with my own improvements.
                                        <br><br>
                                        When I discovered computer science, it felt like a natural extension of my love for engineering. Coding and programming became a medium for limitless creativity and innovation. I started honing my skills, learning programming languages and pushing the boundaries of what I thought was possible.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Today, as a computer science student, I'm grateful for the journey that led me to this point. The fusion of engineering and computer science has become my ultimate passion, allowing me to bring my ideas to life in ways I never thought possible.
										<br><br>
                                        With every project I undertake, I'm reminded of that curious child who dismantled toys and dreamed of building something extraordinary. I'm excited to see where this path of exploration and innovation will lead me next.
